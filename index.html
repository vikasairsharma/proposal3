                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>WordPress is a platform that helps you build websites easily without writing too much code.</p>
                    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fast Development: Use pre-made tools (plugins) to build the rostering system quickly.</li>
                        <li>Easy to Manage: Simple dashboard to add or edit shifts, employees, etc.</li>
                        <li>Low Cost: Cheaper to build by using existing plugins and templates.</li>
                        <li>Expandable: Can add new features (like reporting or notifications) as the business grows.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Limitations:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Less Customization: Pre-made tools might not fit all needs perfectly.</li>
                        <li>Requires Plugins: Additional features may require buying premium plugins.</li>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <h3>What is it?</h3>
                    <p>A hardcoded web app is built from scratch using programming languages (like Python, PHP, or JavaScript).</p>
                    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fully Customized: Made exactly how the owner wants, with specific features and designs.</li>
                        <li>More Control: Complete control over design, functionality, and scalability.</li>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Start with a WordPress-based app. It’s fast, affordable, and user-friendly. Once the business grows and the budget allows, consider upgrading to a custom solution for more advanced features.</p>
